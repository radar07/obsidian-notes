* Application orchestrator (deploys and manages applications)

Kubernetes can deploy the application, scale it up and down dynamically, self-heal it when things go wrong, perform zero-downtime rolling updates and rollbacks

Docker Swarm is still under active development and is popular with small companies that need a simple alternative to Kubernetes.
